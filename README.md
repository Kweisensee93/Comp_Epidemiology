Computational Epidemiology â€“ Summer Semester 2023/24 - Exercise 1a) Implementing Treatment to a SIR model.
This repository is a paper to the following task:
Model the treatment of infected individuals (assuming again life-long immunity).
Implement a new 'Treated' (T) compartment for infected individuals.
Let infected individuals initiate treatment at a certain rate and let treated individuals recover at a faster rate compared to untreated infected.
Model the effect of more and less effective drugs.
What happens if treated individuals are also less infectious than untreated infected?
